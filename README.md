# Prompt-Based Executables (PBE)

**Make AI interactions portable, reproducible, and shareable.**

A Prompt-Based Executable (PBE) is a JSON file that configures AI behavior. Load it into any compatible LLM, and the AI immediately adopts the defined behavior, structure, and personality‚Äîno coding required.

---

## üéØ What Problem Does This Solve?

**The Problem:**
- Every time you use an AI, you start from scratch
- That perfect prompt you crafted yesterday? You have to remember it or dig through chat history
- Want to share your workflow with a teammate? Copy-paste doesn't capture the full context
- Switch from Claude to ChatGPT? Your carefully-tuned interaction style doesn't transfer

**The Solution:**
PBEs are **reusable behavior templates** for AI. Create once, use everywhere, share with anyone.

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Choose a PBE
Browse the [`/pbes/`](/pbes/) directory and pick one that interests you. For example: [`simple_quiz.pbe.txt`](/pbes/interactive_engine/simple_quiz.pbe.txt)

### 2. Copy the entire file content

### 3. Paste it into your LLM
Works with:
- Claude (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)
- Other instruction-following LLMs

### 4. The AI immediately executes
No installation. No setup. No API keys. Just paste and go.

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

A PBE is structured JSON with three core components:

```json
{
  "pbe_name": "unique_identifier",
  "pbe_version": "1.0.0",
  "pbe_class": "interactive_engine",
  "install_instructions": "This is a Prompt-Based Executable...",
  
  "description": "What this PBE does",
  "core_philosophy": { ... },
  "game_structure": { ... },
  "facilitator_techniques": { ... }
}
```

The LLM reads this structure and adopts the defined behavior. It's like loading a cartridge into a game console‚Äîsame console, different game.

## üåü Example: The What-If Game

The PBE that started it all. A text-based game that teaches improvisational systems thinking through creative problem-solving scenarios.

**Load it:** [`what_if_game.pbe.txt`](/pbes/interactive_engine/what_if_game.pbe.txt)

**Try it:** Paste into any LLM and start playing immediately.

**Learn from it:** See how interactive engines structure multi-phase experiences.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether you're:
- **Creating new PBEs** for the community
- **Improving documentation**
- **Testing cross-platform compatibility**
- **Sharing use cases and examples**

**[Read the contributing guide ‚Üí](CONTRIBUTING.md)**

### Quality Standards
- Must follow the [PBE Specification](SPECIFICATION.md)
- Must be tested on at least 2 LLM platforms
- Must include clear description and use case
- Interactive engines need 5+ facilitator techniques

## üöÄ The Vision

PBEs are the first step toward an **AI Operating System**‚Äîa framework where AI behaviors are:
- **Portable** across platforms
- **Composable** into larger systems
- **Trustworthy** by design
- **Open** for everyone

This is infrastructure for human-AI coexistence that prioritizes user wellbeing over corporate interests.

- **PBE Classes:** 2 of 3 implemented (stateless_executor, interactive_engine)
- **Platform Compatibility:** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini (tested)
- **Community:** Just getting started‚Äîbe an early contributor!

## üôè About

The PBE standard was created by a systems thinker who happened to be working in manual labor. Built entirely on a mobile phone over one week using nothing but LLM interactions and determination.

Proof that you don't need a computer science degree or fancy tools to build foundational infrastructure‚Äîyou need systematic thinking and real problems to solve.
